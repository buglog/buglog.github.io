my website:

a key where you can click (or see) which text colors correspond to which media types, i.e. video = purple, photo = cyan, drawing = magenta, text = pink, code = black, sculpture = green.

either you click a media type and it will highlight all the links of that type, or the links will already be that color and the key will just show you which is which.

style:
if you like, add your own css sheets in each subsite. just make sure to link back to the main site or to other subsites.

if you click a link to another subsite from one subsite, it should reflect on the main page that you've been there already.
