  <h2>2025.03.23</h2>
    <p>
      the past few days ive felt like im on autopilor- watching myself do tasks, preloading the next task, timing myelf, skkillfully avoiding social media, sms etc. deleting notifications, meditating, resting where possible, but underneath it all i  efeel a fever which subtends my reality. it is hard . someone i love is going thru it, again, and im purposefully doing nothing about it. and now im like, maybe shes wondering if she will ever hear fom me gagain. and im like- im wondering that too. / shes alive- and im heartbroken. shes in pain, and im confused. i rly dont know what shes dealing with right now. and i dont pretend to know. i beliebe in her, i think. i hope her back heals. i hope she becomes a health nut and a granola bar person and goes for walks and jogs each day, making me look embarrassing by comparisons. but  i look at the situation and i cant exactly predict that that will happen- i do think that hnot having me in the picture ay actually help/ maybe it can give her the spaec she needs to let my words sink in, maybe she can read my absence and take the message from that. hear that/ maybe im actually a genius angel by not responding to her. maybe my indifference is, in fact, a boon to her. these are the things i tell myself to get through these days.
